## Description

Take a step back in time to the days of passing notes in class and AOL instant messaging! Passing Notes is a new messaging app that combines the simplicity of instant messaging with the retro look of the notes you passed in middle school, but these notes will be harder for your teacher to take up and read in front of the class!
